/**
 * Annotation for a method that handles events sent through an {@link EventBus}.
 * The method must have one parameter, which is usually a subclass of
 * {@link GenericEvent}. The method will start receiving events after it is
 * connected to the EventBus using an {@link EventBinder}. Only the parameter of
 * the method is relevant; the name is ignored. For example, the given method
 * will be invoked whenever a ProfileLoadedEvent is fired on the event bus to
 * which the {@link EventBinder} was bound:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}EventHandler
 * void onProfileLoaded(ProfileLoadedEvent event) {
 *   getView().setEmail(event.getProfile().getEmailAddress());
 *   getView().showSignoutMenu();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that an {@link EventBinder} MUST be used to register these annotations,
 * otherwise they will have no effect.
